# Getting Started

Ensure Python is installed.

You may refer to `requirements.txt` to get the exact same dependencies.

Open the terminal to this directory:

Execute the following command to run the Python file:

```powershell
python '.\Postfix++ Interpreter.py'
```

# Settings

Within the Python file, you may set `show_steps` to be `True` or `False`\
to see how the lists are managing alphabets and numbers:

```python
run_postfix_pp_interpreter(show_steps=True)
```

Or

```python
run_postfix_pp_interpreter(show_steps=False)
```
